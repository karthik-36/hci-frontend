The Dashboard style interface with recent events improves efficiency by a wide margin but makes it difficult for users to get summary statistics regarding their donation/reception of food at a single glance. Taking elements from iteration 1, in iteration 2 we focus on trying to find a balance between showing enough information to maintain high efficiency while at the same keeping learnability and readability at an appropriate level so that users can easily understand the data. In iteration 2, we experiment with different designs such as the TImeline which shows the entire list of donated and received items on a date-wise basis. This is poor in efficiency as users will have to scroll to access each item and there\u2019s no summarized data being presented to the users. We then try implementing a simple minimalist interface that shows just summary statistics of each reception/donation. While high in learnability and readability, it doesn\u2019t allow expert users to keep track of their trends and understand whether by how large a margin their contributions. We further designed a more balanced interface that implements both the graph and donation statistics which can be interchanged by clicking on the arrow keys. Taking the best elements from iteration 2, we design the final interface where we implement a graph to show users their trends and compare the donation and reception trends. The graph is large, easily noticeable, and promotes readability.

We focused particularly on matching the user\u2019s mental model and systems model to improve learnability and readability. Another aspect that we were concerned about was user control.
