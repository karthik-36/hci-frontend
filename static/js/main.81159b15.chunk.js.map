We asked our interviewees a few questions to establish their demographics and details regarding their food wastage:\r\n- Who do you live with?\r\n- How much food would you say that your household usually throws away each week?\r\n- What are the main reasons that food gets wasted in your household?\r\n- What motivates you to avoid food waste?\r\n- How often do you donate food? Are there any particular food items that you ve donated/received more than others?\r\n- Are you ok with eating leftovers? If not, what might boost your confidence in eating them?\r\n- How far would you go/travel to pick up free food?\r\n- Have you ever volunteered with a shelter or organization?\r\n- Could you name a few shelters/NGOs in Chicago?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe continued the conversations to get an idea of how aware people are about food wastage and other questions leaning towards user privacy and how ok they would be with sharing their location with unknown people while donating food.\r\n\r\nSurveys\r\n\r\nThe goal of our survey was to gain an understanding of the most frequently performed actions when it comes to food wastage.

The goal of our project is to develop an application that not only raises\r\n            awareness about food wastage but also facilitates the sharing of food between users thereby\r\n            cutting down on the potential wastage. This not only brings the community closer but also allows\r\n            people to meaningfully contribute to NGOs and food-insecure people.\r\n            EVALUATION METHOD\r\n            USERS\r\n            The study was conducted using “Wizard of Oz”, “Think Aloud” methodologies, and paper\r\n            prototypes on 3 users. All 3 users are from CS 522\r\n            FORMATIVE EVALUATION STEPS\r\n            1. Before the users were asked to perform the tasks, they were given a brief introduction of\r\n            the system setup and interactions supported by our systems by a facilitator.\r\n            2. Users were asked to perform 3 tasks\r\n            3. One member of the team observed the users while performing tasks for observations.\r\n            TASKS\r\n            1. TASK CARDS\r\n            Task 1: Add a new listing for donation/food item\r\n            You have a 20-pound unopened bag of Basmati rice that you won’t be able to finish\r\n            off. It expires in a month. Instead of throwing away the rice, you decide to put it up for\r\n            donation so that you can give away the food without wasting it. You want to create a\r\n            new listing for the rice and input the corresponding the details such as the quantity,\r\n            description of the item and how long till the rice expires amongst others. These details\r\n            should be visible so that anyone interested in receiving the item gets all the\r\n            information.\r\n            Task 2: Editing information for an added donation item\r\n            You realize you’ve made a mistake when you were entering the details for the rice.\r\n            You’ve entered the wrong quantity for the amount of rice. Your task is to edit the\r\n            information in the newly added rice listing and rectify the error you’ve made. The listing\r\n            should then show the updated quantity of rice so that all users interested in receiving\r\n            the item get up-to-date information.\r\n            Task 3: Finding a specific food item\r\n            You’ve added cereal to your bowl before realizing that you’re out of milk. Instead of\r\n            going out to buy milk, you want to check and see if anyone in your community\r\n            happens to be donating some milk. Your task is to search for milk in the application\r\n            and accept the donation of someone living nearby and notify them once you’ve\r\n            received the item.\r\n            2. INTERNAL WALKTHROUGH\r\n            Fig 1: Main screen interface Fig 2: New Donation Form\r\n            Task 1: Add a new listing for donation/food item\r\n            Inputs/Assumptions ● User is on the main screen\r\n            Steps\r\n            ● Click on the green ‘plus’ icon in the bottom right\r\n            corner of the interface\r\n            ● On the new form screen, users can start adding\r\n            details in no particular order\r\n            ● Input rice in name of food item and provide a short\r\n            description of rice\r\n            ● Set quantity of rice to 20 and set unit to pounds\r\n            ● Set the expiry date of an item\r\n            ● Click ‘Submit’\r\n            Instructions for user Task Card 1\r\n            Will the users know\r\n            what to do?\r\n            Yes. The user realized they need to click on the ‘plus’ sign to\r\n            add a new donation food item. The user understood that\r\n            clicking on ‘Submit’ in the donation form menu submits the\r\n            listing for rice.\r\n            Will the users see how\r\n            to do it?\r\n            The user went through the first page easily. But got stuck on\r\n            the second page. The Expiry input(‘list for’) was not obvious\r\n            at first glance.\r\n            Will the user see that\r\n            progress is being made\r\n            toward the solution of\r\n            the task?\r\n            Yes, the user accesses the donation form upon clicking the\r\n            ‘plus’ button. Data is being input in a form so users can see\r\n            text fields being filled.\r\n            Walkthrough\r\n            Comments\r\n            ● The ‘List for days’ was unintuitive and\r\n            unrecognizable. Users were unable to understand\r\n            the meaning behind the term. Something along the\r\n            lines of ‘best before’ or ‘expiry’ would be more\r\n            consistent with the real world\r\n            ● The placement and size of ‘Pickup Location’ was not\r\n            noticeable. Also changing it to ‘Select pickup\r\n            location’ would allow users to get a better\r\n            understanding of the action needed to be done\r\n            Fig 3: Accessing Rice item\r\n            from recent community\r\n            donations list\r\n            Fig 4: Rice donation view Fig 5: Editing quantity of rice\r\n            in Donation form\r\n            Fig 6: Accessing rice item\r\n            from timeline\r\n            Fig 7: Rice donation view Fig 8: Editing quantity of rice\r\n            in Donation form\r\n            Task 2: Editing information for an added donation item\r\n            Inputs/Assumptions ● User is on main screen\r\n            Steps\r\n            ● Click on the ‘timeline’ icon\r\n            ● Scroll through timeline till rice item is found\r\n            ● Click on the rice listing\r\n            ● Click on the ‘Edit’ button in the rice information\r\n            dialog box\r\n            ● Enter the correct information in the quantity of rice\r\n            ● Click on the ‘Submit’ button once done\r\n            OR\r\n            ● Scroll through the recent items list to find the\r\n            donated item\r\n            ● Click on the rice listing\r\n            ● Click on the ‘Edit’ button in the rice information\r\n            dialog box\r\n            ● Enter the correct information in quantity\r\n            ● Click on the ‘Submit’ button once done\r\n            Instructions for user Task Card 2\r\n            Will the users know\r\n            what to do?\r\n            The users easily figured out the second path to reach the\r\n            status page but struggled to connect the dots between\r\n            timeline & status.\r\n            Will the users see how\r\n            to do it?\r\n            No, For the first path, the users were unable to figure out\r\n            that clicking on the latest item(in green) would take them to\r\n            the corresponding status page.\r\n            Will the user see that\r\n            progress is being made\r\n            toward the solution of\r\n            the task?\r\n            For the overall task, there is no indicator of progress shown.\r\n            But as screens are displayed to the user, they are able to\r\n            recognize options and icons related to the task which allows\r\n            them to proceed in the right direction.\r\n            Walkthrough Comments ● Timeline icon is not intuitive. Users were unable to\r\n            connect icons to the concept of a timeline. A change\r\n            in a more recognizable icon would be better\r\n            ● When editing the item information, the submit button\r\n            should have been replaced with an update button\r\n            ● All users opted to access rice items through the\r\n            recent community donations list\r\n            ● Misconception regarding community donations on\r\n            the main screen as users were under the\r\n            assumption that the main screen showed users' own\r\n            donations. Placing text above listings to indicate\r\n            community donations would be appropriate\r\n            ● Listings in the timeline doesn’t give affordance of\r\n            being clickable.

This is poor in efficiency as users will have to scroll to access each item and there’s no summarized data being presented to the users. We then try implementing a simple minimalist interface that shows just summary statistics of each reception/donation. While high in learnability and readability, it doesn’t allow expert users to keep track of their trends and understand whether by how large a margin their contributions. We further designed a more balanced interface that implements both the graph and donation statistics which can be interchanged by clicking on the arrow keys.\r\n\r\nTaking the best elements from iteration 2, we design the final interface where we implement a graph to show users their trends and compare the donation and reception trends. The graph is large, easily noticeable, and promotes readability. At the bottom of the screen, we implement summary statistics in a split window to promote readability, increase the efficiency of data being processed and take it one step further by adding a\r\n\r\ntimeline window as well to allow users to gain granular control over the data they’re being shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign Challenge 4: Communication between Donor and Receiver\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESIGN REFLECTIONS\r\n\r\nAditya’s Design Reflection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of general interaction design, our group has focused more on improving the learnability of the application compared to efficiency and safety. Our original ideas were more geared towards efficiency and safety, rather than learnability. But, from the interviews and surveys conducted, we realized that there’s a general lack of awareness when it comes to food donation. We wanted the application to be extremely user-friendly with a focus on high learnability so that users can quickly understand how the interface works and can start donating food. We hope to foster and increase both user and public awareness regarding food wastage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, we’ve selected simple and easily recognizable icons such as the ‘Home’ icon for the main page, the ‘Magnifying Glass’ which is a metaphor for searching, the ‘Speech Bubble’ icon which is a metaphor for communication and the ‘Account’ symbol, through rigorous use is easily recognizable now. Due to the large scope of the target audience, we tried to ensure that whatever icons and metaphors we used in the interface would be easily recognizable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring our group discussions, we kept referring to Nielsen’s 10 principles to refine our design. We focused particularly on matching the user’s mental model and systems model to improve learnability and readability. Another aspect that we were concerned about was user control. A few of the interviewees expressed their concerns about sharing their location with strangers. Taking these into consideration we wanted our users to have complete control over their data. Users can choose to either share their information or designate drop-off locations from where the food item can be collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, I can say that iterating through designs really helps to find potential and/or obscure issues. By coming up with various alternative designs, not only are we discovering new issues in designs that we otherwise thought were bulletproof, but also methods and components that can improve aspects of our design and improve usability principles. We can also mix-match components from multiple designs to create new interfaces which can reduce deficiencies that were originally present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nAditya’s Individual Designs\r\n\r\nAdding new food donations and corresponding information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign Challenge: Keeping track of food donated/received\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign Challenge: Communication between Donor and Receiver\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign Challenge: Searching for donors/shelters/NGO’s in the vicinity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKarthik’s Individual Designs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign Challenge: Searching for donors/shelters/NGO’s in the vicinity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn task 1 - (point 1,2,3 are iterations, point 4,5 are alternatives) you can see that in the first iteration(1) we started off with a listview having most of the interactive components including the search bar on the bottom of the screen so that it's easier for one handed thumb usage but in iteration(3) which is a combination of interaction 1 & 2 we moved it up to the top as we needed to dynamically display the list as the user starts giving input so that we could increase efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign Challenge: Adding new food donations and corresponding information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn task 2 - (point 1,2,3 are iterations, point 4 is an alternative) Iteration one was our very first design where we had assumed that only 1 photo was sufficient and current location would always be the pick up point for the receiver. In iteration 2 we added multiple image support as well as the ability to choose the location. To further improve on efficiency we added a mini map directly in iteration 3 so that the default location was more readable for the user,editable while expanded. point 4 is a non-photo alternative that we thought of for that some standard food outlets could use something like a big mac did not necessarily need a photo but the idea was discarded as there was minimal matching in the requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign Challenge: Keeping track of food donated/received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn task 3 - (point 1,2,5 are iterations, point 3,4 are alternatives) we Initially thought of using the list view again where the list was separated by receiver, donor tabs but at a glance the user was not getting too much information in this layout so we thought of adding a graph in iteration 2 to make all the stats more readable at a glance, the graph would show count of items donated in a time range still separated by a tab. Then in the next iteration(5) we removed the tabs so that we could color code the graph that split donations/receptions along with the stats below to increase efficiency only to come to a point where we realized that it would be incredibly difficult to generate mean data for food measured with different standards. So we chose to discard 1,2,5 and built a timeline view(point 4) similar to phone logs showing donation/reception history in a vertical timeline.\r\n\r\nDesign Challenge: Communication between Donor and Receiver\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn task 4(all points are alternatives). The basic idea always remained the same, having sender message to the left, receiver message to the right. Any other layout I could think of like grid view/ exploded view decreased readability by increasing clutter. So the final design layout looks similar to whatsapp/wechat/fb messenger. There were very few layouts I could think of that could outperform the above in any factor.\r\n\r\nDesign Reflection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn design 1 we first tried to focus more on efficiency only to realize that changing one component might affect another like increasing too much efficiency and making everything on the smartphone reachable by the thumb might decrease learnability & readability due to cluttering. So sometimes we need to balance between different factors. We get only a limited number of points which we could allocate as per our apps needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn design 2 also as per the feedback from interviewees they wanted to know a lot more details about the food then we had previously thought. A simple food name might not suffice to give an incentive to most of our users to use the app & reduce wastage. To make it more trustworthy we had to add in more food detail inputs, multiple photos of food etc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn design 3 We initially wanted to show overall statistics that would sum up the entire history, but as we went on through the iterations we realized that it is difficult to sum up the food donation details as standards for measuring food are dependent on the food itself. Some of the food items were measured in oz,gal,kg,count etc. so the final design we settled for (iteration no. 4) with the timeline view was a massive detour compared to the evolution from iteration 1,2 & 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn design 4 was probably the easiest and straightforward, there is very little scope for improvement when it comes to messaging and that's the reason why most messaging applications use the left(sender) - right(receiver) view to communicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our group discussions we tried to take the best from both our individual iterative designs for each challenge in our final design. Sometimes we took all of one individual contribution and discarded the other and sometimes we tried to mix the best features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, iterating the design & looking into the survey/interview feedback really helps to find potential and ambiguous problems. Methods and components that can improve design aspects and improve usability principles, as well as discover new design issues that were otherwise considered completely safe by developing a variety of alternative designs. Also discover. You can also combine components from multiple designs to create new interfaces that can reduce the defects that originally existed.\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default class About extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h2> concept </h2>\r\n\r\n                <div>\r\n\r\n                Conceptualization and Market Research\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nCONCEPTUAL DIAGRAM PHOTO\r\n\r\n\r\nUSER GOALS\r\n● To prevent wastage of food and keep track of savings\r\n● To know about local donors and shelters in the vicinity\r\n● To see the route from receiver to the donor\r\n● To get information regarding food being donated\r\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND MARKET ANALYSIS\r\n● 16 apps helping companies and consumers prevent food waste - Katerina\r\nBozhinova\r\n○ Multiple applications are leveraging the concept of sharing food to reduce\r\nwastage.
