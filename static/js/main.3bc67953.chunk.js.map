This is poor in efficiency as users will have to scroll to access each item and there’s no summarized data being presented to the users. We then try implementing a simple minimalist interface that shows just summary statistics of each reception/donation. While high in learnability and readability, it doesn’t allow expert users to keep track of their trends and understand whether by how large a margin their contributions. We further designed a more balanced interface that implements both the graph and donation statistics which can be interchanged by clicking on the arrow keys.\r\n\r\n                    Taking the best elements from iteration 2, we design the final interface where we implement a graph to show users their trends and compare the donation and reception trends. The graph is large, easily noticeable, and promotes readability. At the bottom of the screen, we implement summary statistics in a split window to promote readability, increase the efficiency of data being processed and take it one step further by adding a\r\n\r\n                    timeline window as well to allow users to gain granular control over the data they’re being shown.\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <h2>Design Challenge : Communication between Donor and Receiver</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <img src={p1} />\r\n                <img src={p2} />\r\n                <img src={p3} />\r\n\r\n\r\n                \r\n                <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\", }}> <b> Design Reflections </b> </div>\r\n                Aditya’s Design Reflection\r\n                <ul style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\r\n                    <li>In terms of general interaction design, our group has focused more on improving the learnability of the application compared to efficiency and safety.

But, from the interviews and surveys conducted, we realized that there’s a general lack of awareness when it comes to food donation. We wanted the application to be extremely user-friendly with a focus on high learnability so that users can quickly understand how the interface works and can start donating food. We hope to foster and increase both user and public awareness regarding food wastage.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li>During our group discussions, we kept referring to Nielsen’s 10 principles to refine our design. We focused particularly on matching the user’s mental model and systems model to improve learnability and readability. Another aspect that we were concerned about was user control. A few of the interviewees expressed their concerns about sharing their location with strangers. Taking these into consideration we wanted our users to have complete control over their data. Users can choose to either share their information or designate drop-off locations from where the food item can be collected.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li>Finally, I can say that iterating through designs really helps to find potential and/or obscure issues. By coming up with various alternative designs, not only are we discovering new issues in designs that we otherwise thought were bulletproof, but also methods and components that can improve aspects of our design and improve usability principles. We can also mix-match components from multiple designs to create new interfaces which can reduce deficiencies that were originally present.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    \r\n                </ul>\r\n                Karthik’s Design Reflection\r\n                <ul style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        In design 1 we first tried to focus more on efficiency only to realize that changing one component might affect another like increasing too much efficiency and making everything on the smartphone reachable by the thumb might decrease learnability & readability due to cluttering. So sometimes we need to balance between different factors. We get only a limited number of points which we could allocate as per our apps needs.\r\n                    </li>\r\n\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        In design 2 also as per the feedback from interviewees they wanted to know a lot more details about the food then we had previously thought. A simple food name might not suffice to give an incentive to most of our users to use the app & reduce wastage. To make it more trustworthy we had to add in more food detail inputs, multiple photos of food etc\r\n                    </li>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        In design 3 We initially wanted to show overall statistics that would sum up the entire history, but as we went on through the iterations we realized that it is difficult to sum up the food donation details as standards for measuring food are dependent on the food itself. Some of the food items were measured in oz,gal,kg,count etc. so the final design we settled for (iteration no. 4) with the timeline view was a massive detour compared to the evolution from iteration 1,2 & 3.\r\n                    </li>\r\n\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        In design 4 was probably the easiest and straightforward, there is very little scope for improvement when it comes to messaging and that's the reason why most messaging applications use the left(sender) - right(receiver) view to communicate.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n\r\n                In our group discussions we tried to take the best from both our individual iterative designs for each challenge in our final design. Sometimes we took all of one individual contribution and discarded the other and sometimes we tried to mix the best features.\r\n\r\n                In conclusion, iterating the design & looking into the survey/interview feedback really helps to find potential and ambiguous problems. Methods and components that can improve design aspects and improve usability principles, as well as discover new design issues that were otherwise considered completely safe by developing a variety of alternative designs. Also discover. You can also combine components from multiple designs to create new interfaces that can reduce the defects that originally existed.\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/concept.0afd505b.jpeg\";","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport concept from \"./images/concept.jpeg\";\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default class About extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div style={{ fontSize: \"24px \" }}>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h2>  Conceptualization and Market Research </h2>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <img src={concept} />\r\n\r\n                    <br />\r\n\r\n                    <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}> CONCEPTUAL DIAGRAM PHOTO </div>\r\n\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n\r\n                    <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>  <b> USER GOALS </b> </div>\r\n\r\n                    <br />\r\n\r\n                    <ul style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\r\n                        <li>To prevent wastage of food and keep track of savings</li>\r\n                        <li>To know about local donors and shelters in the vicinity</li>\r\n                        <li>To see the route from receiver to the donor</li>\r\n                        <li>To see the route from receiver to the donor</li>\r\n                        <li>To get information regarding food being donated</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n\r\n                    <br />\r\n\r\n                    <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\", }}> <b> LITERATURE REVIEW AND MARKET ANALYSIS </b> </div>\r\n\r\n                    <br />\r\n\r\n                    <ul style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\r\n                        <li>16 apps helping companies and consumers prevent food waste - Katerina\r\n                            Bozhinova - https://www.greenbiz.com/article/16-apps-helping-companies-and-consumers-prevent-food-waste</li>\r\n                        <li> Food Rescue Hero - https://412foodrescue.org/programs/foodrescuehero/</li>\r\n                        <li> Mobile Intraction Design Approaches For  Reducing Domestic Food Wastes - https://eprints.qut.edu.au/82295/8/Geremy_Farr-Wharton_Thesis.pdf</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    </ul>\r\n\r\n                    <br/>\r\n\r\n                    <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}> <b>USER SCENARIOS </b>   </div>\r\n\r\n                    <ul style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Scenario 1: John Doe is a 32-year-old working male.
